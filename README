This is a focus-test I made using front-end tools. I made it for a company I used to work for. The test models an assessment test
that is being used for hiring. In this game, a dot moves in a circle in "intervals". At random points, the dot jumps two intervals instead of one.
You must acknowledge those jumps, by pressing a the spacebar button. 

You should be able to take the test by downloading this folder, and it should also work for mobile phones.

You could follow this link https://focus-test.000webhostapp.com/. to see it in action

Enjoy!
