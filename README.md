This is a focus-test I made using front-end tools. I made it for a company I used to work for. The test models an assessment test
that is being used for hiring. In this game, a dot moves in a circle in "intervals". At random points, the dot jumps two intervals instead of one.
You must acknowledge those jumps, by pressing the spacebar button. 

You should be able to take the test by downloading this folder, and it should also work for mobile phones.

See it in action:
